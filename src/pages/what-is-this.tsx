            If you click the &quot;Send Message&quot; button on the home page,
            it will send the message to our backend and store the message. This
            message has the potential to be viewed by anyone. No personal data
            is available to the person who reads your message outside of the
            message content, the number of views a message has, your selected
            nickname, the date is was sent and the number of upvotes your
            message has.

            If you click the &quot;View Messages&quot; button on the home page,
            it will show you a random message that has been sent by a user. You
            will then have the chance to upvote or downvote the message if you
            so choose.
